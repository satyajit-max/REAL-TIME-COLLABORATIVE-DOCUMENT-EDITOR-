Title: Responsive Webpage with Dynamic API Data (Weather or News)

The objective of this project is to design and develop a responsive web page that dynamically fetches data from a public API, such as a weather or news API, and displays the retrieved information in a user-friendly format. This type of webpage is common in modern web applications where real-time or frequently updated data is essential for user engagement and utility.

Key Objectives:
Real-time Data Retrieval:
The webpage should make HTTP requests to a public API using JavaScript (or any frontend framework) and fetch relevant data such as current weather updates, news headlines, or other public information.

Dynamic Content Display:
The fetched data should be dynamically inserted into the webpage's DOM without requiring a page reload. Users should see up-to-date information upon accessing or interacting with the page.

Responsiveness:
The layout and design must be responsive, meaning the webpage should render properly across different devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Tools and Technologies:
HTML5 & CSS3:
Used for creating the structure and styling of the webpage. CSS Flexbox or Grid will be utilized for layout responsiveness. Optional use of a framework like Bootstrap can help in faster and mobile-first design.

JavaScript (ES6+):
JavaScript will be used for making API requests (via fetch() or axios) and dynamically updating the DOM with the response data.

Public APIs:
You may use any freely accessible APIs. Examples:

OpenWeatherMap API – for real-time weather data.

NewsAPI – for breaking news and headlines.

REST Countries API – for data about countries.
These APIs generally return data in JSON format, which is easy to parse in JavaScript.

Optional Libraries:

Axios: For HTTP requests (alternative to fetch).

Moment.js or date-fns: For formatting date/time data.

Chart.js: If visualizing data with charts is needed.

Code Editor:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any preferred IDE for writing and testing the code.

Browser Developer Tools:
For debugging and inspecting network requests and responses.

Workflow:
Design the layout of the webpage with placeholders for the API data.

Write JavaScript to fetch data from the API when the page loads or on user interaction (e.g., search or refresh button).

Parse the API response and display key information in appropriate HTML elements.

Style the webpage using CSS to ensure it looks clean and professional on all devices.

Test the webpage across different screen sizes and browsers.

Deliverables:
A fully functional, responsive web page.

Data is dynamically loaded from a public API and displayed clearly.

Clean, maintainable code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

Optional: interactive features (e.g., search bar, refresh button).

Outcome:
This project demonstrates essential front-end skills: API integration, responsive design, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript logic—key capabilities for modern web developers. It can serve as a strong portfolio piece or learning exercise for mastering real-world web development concepts.
